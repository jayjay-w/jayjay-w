Hi There, 

I am Joseph (Jay), a software engineer with over 10 years experience. I have worked with many technologies over the years,
but most recently I have been focused on **Ruby and Rails** and **ReactJS**.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on https://github.com/meedan and https://kenyapayroll.com
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NextJS
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any cool open source Ruby on Rails projects
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about *Kenya*...
